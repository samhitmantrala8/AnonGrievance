# Anonymous Complaint Chat Bot

## Overview
The Anonymous Complaint Chat Bot is a project developed for Hackbyte 2.0, the annual hackathon organized by IIIT Jabalpur. The aim of this project is to provide a platform where users can submit complaints or grievances anonymously, along with supporting evidence, without unveiling their identities. 

## Features
- **Anonymous Submission**: Users can submit complaints without revealing any personally identifiable information.
- **Evidence Upload**: Users can upload supporting evidence for their complaints, such as photos, videos, or documents.
- **Complaint Handling**: A system is in place for managing and processing complaints, including categorization and resolution tracking.
- **Moderation**: The platform includes moderation features to filter out inappropriate or irrelevant content.
- **Vulgar Language Detection**: Complaints are passed through a fine tuner to check for vulgar language. If detected, appropriate action is taken to maintain a respectful environment.
- **Security**: Strong emphasis on security practices to protect the anonymity and privacy of users.
- **Feedback and Reporting**: Users can provide feedback on the handling of their complaints and report any issues with the platform.
